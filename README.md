# Canopy
An app designed by women, for women, nonbinary people, and gender minorities, that facilitates an entertaining, dynamic, and fulfilling way to connect with other students in campus organizations.
The goal of this app was to create a safe and welcoming space where gender minorities can foster meaningful connections with the swipe of a finger and using the convenience of an application.
